<p>RPM spec files have a macro, <tt>%config</tt>, that is used to
mark config files so that edits to config files won't get lost during a
subsequent upgrade. Without this, the config files from an upgrade
would tend to overrite the edited files from the previous
version. <tt>%config</tt> can also apper as
<tt>%config(noreplace)</tt>, but there seems to be little or no
documentation on what this means. Here are the results of some
experimentation. The experiments were done on the current version of
RPM for RedHat 9 (ver 4.2 from the rpm-4.2-0.69 RPM). Other versions
may be different.</p>

<p>There are three things that can vary about files in an RPM that is
being upgraded: how the files are marked in the spec file (default,
<tt>%config</tt>, or <tt>%config(noreplace)</tt>), whether the file
itself changed between RPM versions, and whether the file on disk has
been edited between installing one version of the RPM and the
next.</p>

<p>The following table shows what we ended up with after installing an
RPM, optionally editing the resulting files, and then upgrading the
RPM.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5" align="center">

<tr>
  <th>File marked as</th>
  <th>Changed in update RPM?</th>
  <th>On-disk file untouched</th>
  <th>On-disk file edited</td>
</tr>

<tr align="center">
  <td rowspan="2">[default]</td>
  <td>No</td>
  <td>File from update</td>
  <td>File from update</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
  <td>Yes</td>
  <td>File from update</td>
  <td>File from update</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
  <td rowspan="2"><tt>%config</tt></td>
  <td>No</td>
  <td>File from update</td>
  <td>Edited file</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
  <td>Yes</td>
  <td>File from update</td>
  <td>File from update, edited file in <tt>.rpmsave</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
  <td rowspan="2"><tt>%config(noreplace)</tt></td>
  <td>No</td>
  <td>File from update</td>
  <td>Edited file</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
  <td>Yes</td>
  <td>File from update</td>
  <td>Edited file, file from the update in <tt>.rpmnew</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>For the two cases where <tt>(noreplace)</tt> has an effect, there
is also the question of what happens if the status of the file as
defined in the spec file changes. And the answer is:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5" align="center">

<tr>
  <th>File marked as</th>
  <th>Changed in update RPM?</th>
  <th>On-disk file edited</td>
</tr>

<tr align="center">
  <td><tt>Was %config(noreplace), becomes %config</tt></td>
  <td>Yes</td>
  <td>File from update, edited file in <tt>.rpmsave</tt></td>
</tr><tr align="center">
  <td><tt>Was %config,<br>becomes %config(noreplace)</tt></td>
  <td>Yes</td>
  <td>Edited file, file from the update in <tt>.rpmnew</tt></td>
</tr>


</table>

<p>In summary: if a file is not marked as a config file, or if a file
has not been altered since installation, then it will be sliently
replaced by the version from an update RPM. If a config file has been
edited on disk, but is not actually different from one RPM to another
then the edited version will be silently left in place. It is only
when a config file has been edited <em>and</em> is different from one
RPM to the next that what happens depens on the <tt>(noreplace)</tt>
option. If absent, the new file will be installed, and the the old
edited version will be renamed with a <tt>.rpmsave</tt> suffix. If
present, the edited version will be left in place, and the new version
will be installed with a <tt>.rpmnew</tt> suffix. I don't know what
happens if RPM needs to create an <tt>.rpmsave</tt> or
<tt>.rpmnew</tt> file and one already exists - at least in some cases
it seems that the new file isn't written under these
circumstances.</p>

<p>This suggests that in general config files should be marked
<tt>(noreplace)</tt>, unless the change being implimented is
sufficiently major that a config file derived from a previous install
is simpy not going to work. Even then it seens questionalble to me if
installing a new 'default' configuration files is better or worse than
leaving behind an edited one that may not work. YMMV.</p>
